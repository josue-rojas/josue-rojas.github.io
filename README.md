# josuerojasrojas.github.io-react
this is my portfolio page but using react to build it.

### Stuff used

- [React](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
- [Sass on react](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-stylesheet)


Note: if you wish to clone this or download it and run it just make sure when you build to change the build script cause it currently moves the build in a folder that might not exist in your computer. It also builds for jekyll use so at the top it has markdown and it's permalink.
